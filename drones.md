### Drone presentations

[FOSS4G 2014 - Quadcopter Presentation](http://aaronr.github.io/foss4g-2014/quadcopter/) - How to leverage inexpensive quadcopters, cameras and Open Source software to generate useful GIS data.

[FOSS4G 2014 - Leveraging Quadcopter Data For Small Town GIS](http://aaronr.github.io/foss4g-2014/smalltown/) - How small towns (or orgs will limited resources) can leverage Open Source tools and infrastructure to gather, host and serve GIS data.  Quadcopter based imagery is used as the example dataset.

[UW GIS Day - Intro to Quadcopter Data Collection](http://aaronr.github.io/uw-gisday-2014/) - GIS Day presentation on introduction to quadcopter GIS for students and the general community.

[South Whidbey Elementary - MAPS!](http://aaronr.github.io/scienceday2014/) - Presentation on maps for elementary age kids which talked about data gathering and finished with flights over the local elementary school and generating a 3D model and image stitching.

[Geospatial Show and Tell](http://aaronr.github.io/decagon_2015/) - Presentation focused on both incident response (NOAA) and quadcopter work at a geospatial show and tell.  Drone portion focused on Structure from Motion and some flights at Brightwater Treatment Plant, Palouse Falls, and a grain facility in eastern WA.
